# React Shopping Cart

This project was built using React. The goal was to build a small React application to practice some fundementals. Specifically, routing between pages, using hooks for state, and passing functions to other pages.

## How do you start

The application opens to a home page and you can enter the shop by clicking either the "Shop" button in the header or the "Shop Now" button in the center of the page. This will bring you to the products page.

## Products page

Clicking into any of the products pictures will take you to a product specific page. From here you increment or decrement the quantity (which cannot be zero) and then add this to your cart.

## Shopping cart page

Clicking "Add to cart" will automatically take you to your cart and show you all the items you have in your cart. From here you can also increase or decrease their quantity, remove the item completly or go back to the products page by clicking the "keep shopping!" button.

The Checkout button is non-functional and just for show.

Above the checkout button, is displayed the subtotals, calculated tax and shipping, and the total.
